# Resonance Field Generator
Shields. They're cool. But sometimes, they're a liability to pick up; your healing items become useless, and if you take damage all the time a portion of your health is basically gone permanently.
I've introduced a void counterpart to personal shield generators that use healing to decrease your shield recharge delay.


Thanks to the modding discord for making this mod possible, and my friends for brainstorming and revising the ideas.

P.S. if you're using this mod and it seems to be broken overpowered, that's not intentional; send any balance discussion my way.
